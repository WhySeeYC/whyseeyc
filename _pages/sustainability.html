								<p>“Eco Life” has always been a topic I care about in my life. In 2017, while still being a college student, I was so inspired by the CEO of <a href="http://trashisfortossers.com/">Trash is for Tosser</a>, Lauren Singer, and the founder of <a href="http://the%20minimalists/">The Minimalists</a>, Joshua Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus about their personal choices on living a eco-friendly lifestyle.</p>
								<p>Lauren Singer is able to keep the waste that she produced for 8 continuous years in a single mason jar. Her shop business run in Brooklyn follows exactly the package free principle.</p>
								<p>The Minimalists especially inspired me with a single mind-changing sentence:</p>
								<blockquote>
								<p>Things don’t complete us, we are already complete ourselves. — The Minimalists</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>Taking them as the role model of leading an eco-friendly mindset sustainable lifestyle, I established a new understanding about our 								connection to the Mother Earth 🌏.</p>
								<p>Apart from studying my degree in Oxford, some spare time was spent participating in eco-friendly events which I would love to share at this 								platform to encouraging readers also join to make a contribution to the goodness of the mother earth.</p>
								<h1 id="oxunboxed"><strong>OxUnboxed</strong></h1>
								<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.oxfordhub.org/oxunboxed">programme</a></p>
								<ul>
								<li>An event to support local grain agriculture and promote the plastic-free package.</li>
								<li>Volunteers pop up at multiple locations in Oxford bringing seeds, dates, rice, nuts to sell with the customers preparing their own 								containers.</li>
								<li>The average price of ingredients is half of the normal charge from supermarkets.</li>
								</ul>
								<h1 id="climate-change-parade"><strong>Climate Change Parade</strong></h1>
								<ul>
								<li>An event initiated by youngsters (14–16 years old) showing the awareness of the importance of environmental care</li>
								<li>Aiming at policy change to make a big-scale leap forward in environmental protection. Some of the sayings include: “Listen up Teresa May, 								all the sky is going grey!” “What do we want? Climate action! When do we want it? Now!”</li>
								</ul>
								<h1 id="cycle-to-work"><strong>Cycle to work</strong></h1>
								<ul>
								<li>Environmental sustainability exercise that encourages people to cycle to work. This was held by Oxford environmental sustainability team 								part of the UK (nation-wise) Green Impact activity.</li>
								<li>People who participate in the activity will be rewarded with one free breakfast.</li>
								</ul>
								<h1 id="too-good-to-go"><strong>Too Good to Go</strong></h1>
								<ul>
								<li>Food waste reduction app that was originated in Denmark.</li>
								<li>Users are allowed to receive hugely discounted meal options packed in a “Magic Box” and is required to pick up at the specified time slot. 								Usually during 2pm-4pm and 10pm-11pm.</li>
								<li>The collaborating restaurants, bakeries and cafes will be benefitted with reducing the product throwing away each day.</li>
								</ul>
								<h1 id="some-amazing-veganor-veggie-burgers">Some Amazing Vegan(or Veggie) Burgers</h1>
								<p>Everybody knows that my favourite food is burger and being in the UK, loving burger and living a sustainable lifestyle is just as easy! The 								following are some of my fav vegan or veggie burger options👇🏻</p>
								<ul>
								<li><a href="https://www.greenroutes.co.uk/gallery">Green Route Cafe</a>: please try their breakfast bap. Handmade vegan patty with hash brown 								better than any major fast food chain. The owner of the shop is also super cute 😃</li>
								<li><a href="https://www.lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/">Linda McCartney Vegetarian Burgers</a>: This brand has the vegetarian burger that taste 								most similar to general burger. Although Richmond’s vegan sausages win over way much than Linda McCartney’s 🤓</li>
								</ul>
								<h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1>
								<p>For so often we hear “Those who produce the most environmental wastes are the big companies and manufacturers, there wouldn’t be any 								difference if I change my lifestyle to help the environment.”</p>
								<p>Well actually, there is. Being an individual on this planet, there are a lot of things we can do. One is being more conscious at our own 								waste production and second, more importantly, is to be politically aware of the laws and regulations which can further put threats on the 								environment or can help restore wellness to the mother earth.</p>
								<blockquote>
								<p>To make an impact on the environmental protection: 1. Being conscious at personal waste production as an individual. 2. Acquiring more 								political awareness on the policies regarding climate change</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>Last but not least, I hugely encourage you to listen to the podcast <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?								feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8yNzkwNTQucnNz&amp;episode=QnV6enNwcm91dC0xNjg0NjI0&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;ep=6&amp;at=1570589847349">								“Climate policy and individual action: two approaches, one climate emergency” produced by Anja Kollmuss</a>. There, she demonstrated her 								dedication to international environmental policy. To me, I was especially inspired by the fact that she turned her culture shock (for she 								being Sweden-raised and American-educated) into powerful action on the leaf of environmental policy.</p>
