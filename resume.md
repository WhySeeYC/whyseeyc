## Research Experiences

[Bayesian Network Informed Key Factors for Liver Regeneration (3 months)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yi-chun-w_ismrm-mri-bayesian-activity-7027522524452159488-viRW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

- Motivation: Currently there is no effective way to identify which factor drives liver regeneration after surgery and the variability of regenerated liver is volume huge between cases.
- Result: This work used Bayesian network to produce a conditional probability graph that demonstrates the key factor for liver regeneration is post-operative liver iron concentration. This work is **accepted by APASL 2023 conference**


[Bayesian Network Reveal the Interplay Between Quantitative Liver MRI Metrics (6 months)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yi-chun-w_worldradiographyday-mri-ismrm-activity-6995750947612147713-ggnI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

- Motivation: Identifying the causal relationships and confounding factors between  MRI metrics is cruicial for accurate liver health assessment.
- Result: This work generated 48 Bayesian networks and proven causal reationship from PDFF to cT1 and Volume which was backed up by literatures. The confounding role of PDFF was also identified by this project. This work is **accepted by ISMRM 2023 conference**.

<!-- 
[LiverMultiScan Clinical Systematic Literature Review (4 months)]()

- Motivation: To provide evidence of medical device clinical utility and its developement with Japan PDMA and FDA submission.

- Motivation: To see if introducing pineapple juice as a contrast agent will introduce bias on quantitative MRI reporting for liver metrics.
- Result: The results proved that pineapple juice does not introduce noticeable bias towards liver MR metrics. This work is **presented in ISMRM 2022 conference**.
- Skill: implemented Python libraries:`os`, `pdfplumber` to conduct data cleaning and organising; `Scipy` to perform statistical analysis, sensitivity & specificity analysis; `matplotlib` and `pandas` for result visualisation  -->

- Motivation: To compare radiotherapy treatment efficacy between two different dose optimisation techniques.
- Result: this work proposed a novel treatment planning concept that potentially reduces the side effect of radiotherapy. This work was also **accepted for PTCOG 2020 conference poster presentation**.
<!-- - Skill: visualized ionising radiation dose data to show tumour coverage with `Raystation 7`, `Python Pandas, Numpy` -->

<!-- [Comparisons of Blood flow Conditions of Carotid Artery Before and After Exercise (3 months)]()

### STAR

- Leadership: I had the vision to improve our comapny's technical support capability by translating technical documentations into the native laguage for the patnering imaging center, I enroled a team to help me to deliver the vision with setting up translation/review pipeline, re-directing budget allocation and automate feedback collection mechanism. Today, we hit the milestones of supporting 5 major languages and received at least 10 pieces of positive feedback. Most importantly, we leverage one of the biggest strength here in Perspectum, a talent pool that consist of at least 28 nationalities.
