## Research Experiences

[Bayesian Network Informed Key Factors for Liver Regeneration (3 months)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yi-chun-w_ismrm-mri-bayesian-activity-7027522524452159488-viRW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

- Motivation: Currently there is no effective way to identify which factor drives liver regeneration after surgery and the variability of regenerated liver is volume huge between cases.
- Result: This work used Bayesian network to produce a conditional probability graph that demonstrates the key factor for liver regeneration is post-operative liver iron concentration. This work is **accepted by APASL 2023 conference**


[Bayesian Network Reveal the Interplay Between Quantitative Liver MRI Metrics (6 months)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yi-chun-w_worldradiographyday-mri-ismrm-activity-6995750947612147713-ggnI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

- Motivation: Identifying the causal relationships and confounding factors between  MRI metrics is cruicial for accurate liver health assessment.
- Result: This work generated 48 Bayesian networks and proven causal reationship from PDFF to cT1 and Volume which was backed up by literatures. The confounding role of PDFF was also identified by this project. This work is **accepted by ISMRM 2023 conference**.

<!-- 
[LiverMultiScan Clinical Systematic Literature Review (4 months)]()

- Motivation: To compare radiotherapy treatment efficacy between two different dose optimisation techniques.
- Result: this work proposed a novel treatment planning concept that potentially reduces the side effect of radiotherapy. This work was also **accepted for PTCOG 2020 conference poster presentation**.
<!-- - Skill: visualized ionising radiation dose data to show tumour coverage with `Raystation 7`, `Python Pandas, Numpy` -->

<!-- [Comparisons of Blood flow Conditions of Carotid Artery Before and After Exercise (3 months)]()

    Words from Joe Yeh
    
    [敬請分享此資訊，邀請在英國的友人一起交流 ! ]
    
    我將在 10/17 於英國的 Alan Turing Institute 分享雲象科技在數位病理 AI 上的研發成果 ! 這是今年令我最感到興奮的一次演講機會。Alan Turing Institute 是英國頂尖的資料科學及 AI 研究機構。我的博士班研究主題也和 Alan Turing 在 pattern formation上面的理論工作有極高的關聯。我和實驗室同仁合作的文章標題裡面就有Turing 先生的名字, "Self‐organizing hair peg‐like structures from dissociated skin progenitor cells: [New insights for human hair follicle organoid engineering and Turing patterning in an asymmetric morphogenetic field](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/exd.13891). 在這次的演講裡面，我會分享我們過去兩年內在數位病理AI最精華的研發成果，分享在尖端技術研究上做的努力，並討論數位病理 AI 的前景與挑戰。非常感謝在英國的台灣學人協助安排此次演講事宜，期待和在英學人有更多的交流機會!
