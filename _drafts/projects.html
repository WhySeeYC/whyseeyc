							<h2 id="pineapple-juice-project">Quantitative MRI Contrast Project</h2>
							<p>Pineapple juice was a negative contrast agent we give to participant before their MRI scans. Because of its high concentration of Manganese, the gastrointestinal tract filled with pineapple juice will show dark and hence increase the visibility of other structures. The main purpose this research project though, instead of focusing on visual improvement on images, was to investigate whether it affect other biomarkers’ reliability. I use libraries such as <code>pandas, bumpy, matplotlib and scipy</code> to conduct analysis. One of the major analysis methodology I learned during this project is the “Bland Altman” analysis. It is a statistical method relating mean and differences for 2 measurements with scatter plots visual representation. Often it is used to compare whether one newly developed measurement method is in agreement with a relatively more established methods. It is also use to judge measurement precision i.e. repeatability and reproducibility for the same measurement method.</p>
							<p>To me this is one of the best scientific project I was assigned to. Upon presenting to my colleagues, not only did I showed improved skilling in coding but I also provided the answer that was demanded by many of our clients. The associated experience of collaborating with SWE team also make me realise my contribution in a scalable business. 👩🏼‍💻</p>

							<p><a href="https://youtu.be/GkNbPzO1QAc">Build a Finance App with Python Part1</a></p>
							<p><a href="https://youtu.be/WZdtNVIeHtw">Build a Finance App with Python Part2</a></p>
							<p>In this project I used Python <code>Tkinter</code> to build a minimal finance app called fYnanCe. The library learned were <code>pandas</code>, <code>pdfplumber</code>, <code>re</code>, <code>Tkinter</code> and <code>unicodedata</code>. The most difficult part is to work around the associated troubles came along with the <code>mainloop()</code> function from <code>Tkinter</code>.</p>
							<p>This project took me only 2 days! I am very happy to independently complete.😻 Thanks all! Stay tune to how fYnanCe will evolve later one!</p>
							<p>For this progress, most effort was put in using frames to set functions and figures in compartments as well as connecting the main functions with <code>matplotlib</code> to throw graphs on the screen. The final figures are not very accurate which will be properly improved through the next update. This progress took me 2 weekends and I always code on the train somehow haha. 🚅</p>
							<p>Thanks all! Stay tune to how fYnanCe will evolve later on!</p>

							<h2 id="how-i-use-regular-expression-to-manage-pdf-data">Use regular expression to manage PDF data</h2>
							<p>In this project I used Python regular expression to extract payslip information from a multiple-page PDF. The library learned were <code>pandas</code>, <code>pdfplumber</code>, <code>re</code>, and <code>unicodedata</code>. Data cleaning is the most part of this project and the most tedious one. However, now we can finally start using the tool to conduct visualisation. On a side note, I am also planing to write a parallel program that use <code>startswith()</code> method to achieve the same goal. Watch out!</p>
							<p>This project took me 4 months! I am very happy to independently complete.😻 Thanks all!</p>
