							<h2 id="how-to-manage-research-data-mantra">How to Manage Research Data/ MANTRA</h2>
							<p>Created: December 22, 2019 12:37 AM</p>
							<p>At the end of 2019, 31st Dec, I finished the 9 modules of the online course <strong>MANTRA Research Data Management,</strong> which is an open-access online training provided by the University of Edinburgh. I truly wish I came across MANTRA at least a year earlier😿.</p>
							<p>Still remember while I was in my master thesis research, at the beginning I commit myself to document my daily experiment report/ findings/ techniques, etc. As time went on, I started to find that there were, for so many times, no significant findings or zero progress. I then started to question myself whether I should document every trivial piece of the research journey. 🤔Plus, the research was based on the institutional computer which I had no right to carry back home with me. My supervisor suggested me to use a USB drive to save my data. I said yes but was thinking to use google drive as that I could access everything wherever I was. And I did. However, the experiment and analysis could only be run by specific software installed and thus the data saved can also only be visualised under that environment. I, therefore, was thinking about using something called “team viewer” to remotely control the institutional computer in case I needed to evaluate something during midnight. 🤓But there came another problem that my laptop was Mac and obviously was different from the Windows system. So I found quite difficult to operate. Later on, I also soon realised how morally unacceptable it could be to do. If my colleagues need to use the same computer in the office, it would’ve been in vain because the hardware is occupied by an invisible person and the data can be sensitive information of the study samples!😱</p>
						
							<p>This is life before MANTRA. Although I successfully completed the research, I still feel there are so many aspects I could’ve to improve by gaining more knowledge about how to deal with the data. 😔</p>
							<p>I strongly encourage students, especially <strong>PhD or master by research students</strong>, to complete this self-learning online modules. It will also be beneficial to those who were <strong>senior</strong> ahead the trend of IT revolution, I mean age-wise because MANTRA also clearly explains <strong>the history of data evolution</strong> and thus evolving file or data types (images, numerical data, code, text, audio files, videos or invisible data like neuron signals). MANTRA also introduce how to organise and secure your research data.</p>
							<p>Most importantly, at the <a href="https://mantra.edina.ac.uk/storageandsecurity/">“Storage and Security Module”,</a> you can get an idea about how to avoid breaching laws or putting yourself in danger while sharing opinions (even in daily circumstances!).🚨</p>
							<p>Another important aspect I also care about is the <a href="https://mantra.edina.ac.uk/sharingpreservationandlicensing/">“Licensing Module”</a> of research data. As a master student who just got out of college, I had never thought of research data can be seriously licensed. I only knew in the business world people will do it. However, in MANTRA, there are insights about the resources you can access to turn your research into a profitable product. In this case, for many <strong>startup companies or SEOs</strong> aiming to leverage their business level, MANTRA will also be a relatively affordable method comparing to consulting licensing agent. 👩🏼‍💻</p>
							<p>Finally, I think for the <strong>general public</strong>, MANTRA can provide some sort of ideas of how you can manage administrative documents. We all know that soon in the future, almost everything will be digitised.</p>
							<aside>
								<p>💡 It will be worth doing while learning MANTRA Research Data Management is to transform the information into workable-tools. This way, you can reference back to the note specifically suiting your need. 👉🏻Check out my organised workflow in this <a href="https://www.notion.so/c4224925cc3e49e58cc67fed39d3349c">Notion Note Book: WhySee MANTRA Note Book</a>.</p>

							<p>Good luck managing your research data everyone~ I hope this post provides some sort of value. Just to mention, I am not affiliated with the University of Edinburgh. I am just truly grateful they provide this wonderful content. 😀</p>

							<p>In this blog post, I would love to share the journey of me learning R, the programming language which is considered the great tool of statistical analysis. Mainly focus on the review of recent finished online course R: Introduction provided by Barton Poulson. He is the founder of <a href="https://datalab.cc/#welcome/ready">DataLab</a> and has received amazing records of his clear explanation on programming training. Earlier in 2019, I also completed his online courses: Python Essentials on LinkedIn Learning. (which is another masterpiece👍🏼)</p>
							<p>This course R: Introduction is amazing! It gives you a holistic introduction about R functions. I find Barton Poulson cute that he is especially good at using some ancient artistic piece to explain specific concepts 👨🏻‍🎨. During the course, there were also many chances he would refer back to the official R documents and open-access libraries. It is helpful when you want to explore more about specific functions of the operators.</p>
							<p>Notes in the Oxford Independent Coffee Project: examples of learning “Factor” in R</p>
							<p>Though the overall length of the video was 2 hrs, it took me around 10 hrs to complete🙇🏻‍♀️. This was because I especially find difficulty in understanding the session of “Factor”. The problem was if you are only looking and not trying hand-on exercise, the concept is not only hard to pursue but also scarcely stay. What I did to help me get through the idea was by trying to explain with my own examples. This is also the time I would love to share with you the <strong><em><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HHbPicNgjVvKhst4NjdukcU3i-bFVp4r/view?usp=sharing">“Oxford Independent Coffee Project: Coffee for Data Science”</a></em></strong>. Whist merely visiting the coffee shops during my study, I think it will be interesting to collect the consumer features as the data point and create an independent side project to learn data science. I am not going into detail here, follow this <em>👉🏻<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HHbPicNgjVvKhst4NjdukcU3i-bFVp4r/view?usp=sharing">link</a></em> to find out more.</p>
							<p>The other difficult component of the course is the “Modelling Data” where Barton Poulson shared the key methods we do Hierarchical Clustering, Principle Component Analysis and Regression. Similar to the above, I used the <strong><em>[“Oxford Independent Coffee Project”</em></strong>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HHbPicNgjVvKhst4NjdukcU3i-bFVp4r/view?usp=sharing) as an example.</p>
							<p>This course is also featured by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V8eKsto3Ug">freeCodeCamp.org</a> on their youtube channel. So it’s completely free and I think it is a really good start for the beginner like me who want to get his or her feet wet in R. Moving on, I think it will be great to stretch into more detailed functions and follow a guide in a thorough and slow-pace process because with videos we can easier get distracted (okay I know. Maybe it’s only me YC😅). I recommend this book: <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz">R for Data Science</a> which is also what I a currently using and have finished Chapter 3. See my [<strong>Reading list](https://www.instagram.com/WhySeeYC/).</strong></p>
							<p>Finally, what I would have to say is that I used to be someone who hates coding. I always told myself: you don’t have the patience to do it. But soon I realise it was just my excuse. And I have found the power of acquiring this skill 🤓. So if you are like me, maybe consider ditch that illusion and start learning. Also let me tell you, the best way to get you to understand the logic of the programming languages is by using your own examples. For instance, I love coffee and I understand what are the features that make good and successful coffee shops, so I like to collect the coffee data and explain the logic with those data rather than just following the guide on the data of a bunch of cars produced in the 1940s (When you start learning, you will know that that is the generic database R provides). ( I simply have no idea what are those car. Yes, I don’t drive and I am a girl who understands nothing about cars, so. 🤪 )</p>
							<p>If you feel lonely, follow me on <strong><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a></strong> and stay tuned on the <strong><em><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HHbPicNgjVvKhst4NjdukcU3i-bFVp4r/view?usp=sharing">“Oxford Independent Coffee Project: Coffee for Data Science”</a></em></strong>.

							<aside>
								<p>🙋🏻‍♀️ Hey all, this is an aggregated list about bibliometrics, which are used as insights to measure the quality and popularity of publications such as books, monographs, journal articles, etc. Resource: the Metrics Tookit.</p>
							</aside>
							<p><a href="https://www.metrics-toolkit.org">Metrics Toolkit</a></p>
							<h1 id="bibliometrics">Bibliometrics</h1>
							<ol type="1">
								<li><p><strong>h-index</strong> → For example, an author with an h-index of 6 has at least six publications that have each been cited at least six times each.→ benefits more experienced scholars over early-career individuals.</p></li>
								<li><p><strong>AAS</strong></p></li>
								<li><p><strong>blog mentions</strong> → Altmetric track blog mentions since 2011</p></li>
								<li><p><strong>citation percentiles and “highly cited” labels</strong></p></li>
								<li><p><strong>citations, Articles</strong> → reliable from 1900 to present</p></li>
								<li><p><strong>citations, books</strong> → most databases only track citations for books published in the 20th century</p></li>
								<li><p><strong>data citation</strong> →</p>
									<p>limitation: Data citation is still relatively rarely practiced, with only half of journals providing instruction for how to cite data and more than 88% of all Data Citation Index records going un-cited. 61% of articles in the social sciences fail to provide any type of citation to the dataset.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><p><a href="https://blog.datacite.org/data-citation-display/">What is the difference between <strong>citations</strong>, <strong>references</strong>, and <strong>relations?</strong></a></p>
											<p>Datasets can be related to other academic resources in a number of different ways. When members deposit related identifiers, they can indicate what the exact relationship between the dataset and the other resource is. The current version of the DataCite Metadata Schema (DataCite Metadata Working Group, <a href="https://blog.datacite.org/data-citation-display/#ref-https://doi.org/10.14454/7xq3-zf69">2019</a>) even offers 33 possible relationTypes to select from! DataCite staff took time to consider these different relation types, discussed the options with different expert groups, and developed a proposal to classify the links into three specific categories: citations, references, and relations. We presented this proposal at the Force2019 Edinburgh and Research Data Alliance Helsinki meetings last October.</p>
											
											<p>Here we will describe each category, and we will use a definition of the term data citation as a point of departure.</p>
											<blockquote>
												<p>The term ‘data citation’ is generally understood to mean the referral to data for credit attribution and facilitation of access to the data. At their most basic level, data citations are mentions of datasets by other academic resources, indicating that these academic resources made use of and/or build on the dataset.</p>
											</blockquote>
											<p>In our proposal, we identified six relation types that we use to classify links as <strong>citations</strong>. Figure 2 (Left) shows the six relation types we use for classifying citations. We took two factors into account for the classification. First, does the nature of the relationship imply use of the dataset (was it cited, referenced, or a supplement to)? Secondly, we looked at the direction of the relationship. We classify a link as a citation only when the relationships are <strong>inward-looking</strong>. That is to say when the relation type points towards use of the dataset.</p>
											<p>The second category, references, are the opposite of citations. It makes use of the same six relation types with the difference that the links’ relationships are <strong>outward-looking</strong>. Figure 2 (Center) shows the six relation types we use for classifying <strong>references</strong>.</p>
											<p>Finally, there will be other links to express a variety of additional relationship types, such as those that suggest provenance, for example, or those that indicate version relationships. We’re grouping all of the remaining relationship types under the heading <strong>relations</strong>. This way, all of the relationship information we have is exposed, but it’s not all given the same degree of importance.</p>
											<p>Figure 2 explains which types of relationships are included in the three different categories. References are the inverse of citations, which basically means datasets mentioning that they used another academic resource. Relations are all other links between datasets and academic resources. This example shows a dataset (DAT icon) and the type of relationships that would classify the links to/for that dataset in each category.</p>

											<li><p><strong>citation software</strong></p></li>
											<li><p><strong>downloads, articles</strong> → does not necessarily mean the accurate usage of the article</p></li>
											<li><p><strong>downloads, books and book chapters</strong></p></li>
											<li><p><strong>facebook: posts, comments, likes, shares</strong> → correlation between facebook metrics and article citations is weak</p></li>
											<li><p><strong>Field Normalised citation impact (FNCI)</strong> →The FNCI was conceived to facilitate the benchmarking of citation performance across groups of different size, disciplinary scope, and age, such as research large groups, institutions, or geographic regions</p></li>
											<li><p><strong>Github: Forks, Collaborators, Watchers</strong> → forks happens when someone make a copy of a repository(a group of files)</p></li>
											<li><p><strong>Goodread ratings and review</strong></p></li>
											<li><p><strong>Journal acceptance rate</strong></p></li>
											<li><p><a href="https://www.metrics-toolkit.org/journal-impact-factor/"><strong>Journal Impact Factor</strong></a> →a measure of the frequency with which the “average article” in a journal has been cited in a particular year or period. The annual JCR impact factor is a ratio between citations and recent citable items published.</p></li>

											<li><p><strong>monograph holdings</strong></p></li>
											<li><p><strong>monograph sales and ranking</strong> → get from Amazon sale</p></li>

											<li><p><strong>Relative citation ratio</strong></p></li>
											<li><p><strong>twitter mention</strong> → used to provide preliminary insight into how a paper is being received and discussed within a research community.</p>
												<p>Note that contrary to popular belief, research outputs do not have to be tweeted using DOI links (e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-017-0014-x">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-017-0014-x</a>) in order to be tracked by altmetrics services–nearly all services now are able to identify tweeted scholarly outputs in other ways.</p>
												<p>Twitter citation counts and contextual demographic and network information can be used to identify the sharing of and reach of information about research on social media, especially within the first weeks of publication (Priem &amp; Costello, 2010).</p></li>
												<li><p><strong>Wikipedia mention</strong> → Additionally, Wikipedia’s coverage of the published literature is relatively narrow and more evidence about the relationship between Wikipedia citations and other metrics, such article citations counts, is needed. A recent study did find that Open Access and high impact journals were more likely to be on English Wikipedia.</p></li>

							<h2 id="the-experience-as-a-nature-communication-associated-editor">The Experience as a Nature Communication Associated Editor</h2>
							<aside>
								<p>🙋🏻‍♀️ When I was doing my masters degree in Oxford. One of the career talks really attracted my attention was is from a Nature Communication Associated Editor, Anne Mirabella. The value of experience she shared I found potentially will be very valuable to some of my readers, please enjoy.</p>
							</aside>
							<p>Anne noted that she started to have a taste of what it feels like to conduct research during her years as a PhD student and post doctoral researcher in London. During the course, she explore the possibility to become a a Nature Communications Editor as a career choice. Here are some of her insights:</p>
							<h3 id="for-those-who-wants-to-publish-to-nature">For those who wants to publish to Nature:</h3>
								<p><strong>How to get published:</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Be realistic</li>
									<li>Think about your audience</li>
									<li>Do read instruction for the author from nature website</li>
									<li>Be clear each step</li>
									<li>Cover letter submitted along with should be honest</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>How to deal with referee:</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Don’t try to give aggressive argue</li>
									<li>Instead, be concise. (Step by step)</li>
									<li>The beauty of Nature → does not require Format</li>
									<li>During the editing process, there are many selecting criteria. Communication and negotiation are key. When you are unhappy about 								the editors’ decision. There are always appealing space. During your argument, don’t over sale yourself.</li>
									<li>Another thing to consider is to transfer your publication to another system.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3 id="for-those-who-would-like-to-pursue-the-similar-career-as-her">For those who would like to pursue the similar career as her:</h3>
									<p>The editorial process consists of many steps and is not straight forward. The majority of time of your day will be reading and there are a lot of decision making. There will be some pressure in target number time but over time, you will slowly get confidence at your decision. One good practice is to always communicate via email, always consult with other specialists to see how they choose reference. You will also need to have a broad understanding of the field and give constructive reviews (not just filling in comments) in an efficient manner. Go to conferences earlier to interact with the scientists. What makes a good associate editor is to be <strong>open to conflict</strong>. If the author asked a question you are not comfortable to answer, you can tell the author “It’s not of my expertise, so I might not be the right person to answer this question”</p>
								<p><strong>Pros:</strong> You are seeing a product to be built early on. Flexible working hours 2 days from home</p>
								<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Time management is key. Sitting all day behind PC</p>
								<p><strong>How to Prepare</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>To prepare: familiarise with Editorial Talent tool,. write summary for journal</li>
									<li>Read broadly, not just specialist in one topic</li>
									<li>Many works roles are available on websites (assistant editor senior editor team manager chief editor with other journals), ask for 								shadowing an editor’s day to day for at least months</li>
									<li>Ask policies about foreign workers (you don’t need to be put off by not being a native English speaker. Anne is Italian and Nature will not exclude non English nationals)</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Interview process</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Phone call interview: Answer questions in smart way</li>
									<li>Manuscript test: topic is given, try to send in a summary within 1-2hr for 2 topics</li>
									<li>Onsite manuscript test: summarise 2 manuscripts in 1 hr</li>
									<li>Onsite interview with chief editor</li>
								</ul>
