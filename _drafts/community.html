									We all know that career transition into tech is an uphill battle. Even with a background in medical imaging where the feild is constantly evolving, I already found it challenging to keep up with technology and latest software updates. I created this platform to build a community and include people who are considering joining tech sectors through skills of technical writing and programming.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									It would also be nice to share with you my career journey and life experiences so that we can support each other in the process of growth. As a first generation immagrant who left Taiwan and came to the UK alone without support from family, I have been through various setbacks, challenges and rejections. Knowing that my experience and help others is truly rewarding to me. So let's connect!
