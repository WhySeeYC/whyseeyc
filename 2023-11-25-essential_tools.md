As a PhD student, I have to juggle many tasks and projects at the same time. That's why I rely on some amazing tools that help me stay organized, productive and creative. In this blog post, I want to share with you these tools and the tips I really like about them.

1. Notion: Notion is a powerful app that lets you create notes, documents, databases, wikis and more. You can customize it to suit your needs and preferences. I use Notion to keep track of my research progress, literature review, deadlines, meetings and personal goals. I love how Notion lets me link different pages and embed various types of media. It's like having a digital brain that stores everything I need.

2. VS code: VS code is a code editor that supports many languages and extensions. I use VS code to write and debug my code, as well as to collaborate with other researchers. VS code has a built-in terminal, a live server, a code formatter and a debugger. It also integrates with GitHub, which makes version control easier. I like how VS code is fast, lightweight and customizable.

3. Zotero: Zotero is a reference manager that helps you collect, organize and cite your sources. I use Zotero to manage my bibliography and generate citations in various styles. Zotero can automatically import metadata from websites, PDFs and databases. It also syncs with cloud storage and word processors. I appreciate how Zotero saves me time and hassle when dealing with references.

4. MS Edge: MS Edge is a web browser that offers many features and benefits. I use MS Edge to browse the web, read articles, watch videos and access online services. MS Edge has a built-in PDF reader, a screenshot tool, a collections feature and a reading mode. It also supports extensions, themes and syncs with other devices. I enjoy how MS Edge is fast, secure and user-friendly.

5. Figma: Figma is a design tool that lets you create and edit graphics, prototypes and animations. I use Figma to design my presentations, posters, flyers and logos. Figma has a vector editor, a grid system, a pen tool and a library of icons and fonts. It also allows for real-time collaboration, feedback and sharing. I admire how Figma is versatile, intuitive and elegant.
